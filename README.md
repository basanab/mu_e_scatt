# muon_electron scattering study using python
When muons with energy E_mu interacts with atoms/matters, one of the possible muon-electron elastic scattering. so, The electron due to the influence of the incoming muon, gets scattered off with an angle theta_e and with energy E_e'. Similarly, the muon gets scattered off with an angle of theta_mu and with energy E_mu'. The angles are measured with respect to a reference axis (here z-axis).

Here are some of the python codes to:
- Creat a datasheet based on theoritical formulas of two body kinematics (for mu-e elastic scattering ) and using the datasheet plot the graph of theta_mu vs theta_e. The code 1te_tm_plot.ipyb represents the same.
- The code plots.C shows how to read the output file from the simulation and plot various graphs using ROOT
